<h1 align="center">Welcome to my GitHub! :sunglasses: </h1>

### :wave: Hi there!

A bit about me:

- :round_pushpin:  Vancouver, BC, Canada (but I'm from Sao Paulo, Brazil)

- :briefcase:  In Brazil I'd worked for almost 6 years in the insurance brokerage market, working as a Relationship Manager and later as a Project Manager for M&A transactions.

- :computer:  I decided to change careers after realizing that even truly loving what I was doing before, I wanted to be challenged and move to Canada to pursue a Post-Degree Diploma in Web and Mobile Development. It has been a bumpy road so far, but loving it so much!

- :books:  Bachelor in International Relations, Technology Diploma in Finance and a Post-Degree Diploma in Web and Mobile Development
